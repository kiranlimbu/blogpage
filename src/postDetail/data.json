We handle various forms of computing and communication devices every day. There is a high chance that these devices are connected to the internet of things and passing information to one another, making it easy for someone with hostile intentions to steal your information and harm you.

While passwords do authenticate users, weak passwords are susceptible to password cracking. 59% of the user use their name/birthdate in their password (Google/Harris Poll, 2019).

Simple passwords are easy prey to brute force attacks. Google survey shows that 24% of Americans have used common passwords like 'abc123', 'Password', 'Admin', 'Iloveyou' and '123456' (Google/Harris Poll, 2019).

If one of your accounts gets hacked, attackers can try the same credential to gain access to your other accounts. In 2019, a Google security survey found that at least 52% of people still reuse the same password for multiple accounts (Google/Harris Poll, 2019). Reusing a password for your email account is even riskier because hackers could use it to reset all other passwords.

However, there are many different applications that make managing passwords easy. Password managers are a program that helps you keep track of allyour username and passwords.

Applying a strong password is an effective way to strengthen your security. A strong password provides the first line of defense against hackers, reduces chances of brute force attack, and limits multiple hacks. We may not be able to stop the hackers from trying to break into our account, but we can take a stronger security stance to protect ourselves. It is our responsibility to keep our information safe.</p>"
